# Migration Consolidation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the consolidation of migration files where separate "create table" and "create procedure" migration files were merged into single migration files.

## Changes Made

### Files Updated (Consolidated)
The following table migration files were updated to include stored procedure creation:

1. **Product Management**
   - File: `20250921000001_product_management_tables.cjs`
   - Added procedures from: `20250921000007_create_product_procedures.cjs`
   - Status: ✅ Merged

   - Status: ✅ Merged

3. **Service Management**
   - File: `20250921000003_service_management_tables.cjs`
   - Added procedures from: `20250921000009_create_service_procedures.cjs`
   - Status: ✅ Merged

4. **Order Management**
   - File: `20250921000004_order_management_tables.cjs`
   - Added procedures from: `20250921000010_create_order_procedures.cjs`
   - Status: ✅ Merged

5. **Product Reviews**
   - File: `20250921000005_product_reviews_table.cjs`
   - Added procedures from: `20250921000011_create_review_procedures.cjs`
   - Status: ✅ Merged

6. **Notification System**
   - File: `20251001000002_notification_system_table.cjs`
   - Added procedures from: `20251001000006_create_notification_procedures.cjs`
   - Status: ✅ Merged

7. **Business Settings**
   - File: `20251001000003_business_settings_table.cjs`
   - Added procedures from: `20251001000007_create_business_settings_procedures.cjs`
   - Status: ✅ Merged

8. **Service Inquiry**
   - File: `20251005000002_create_service_inquiry_table.cjs`
   - Added procedures from: `20251005000003_create_service_inquiry_procedures.cjs`
   - Status: ✅ Merged

9. **Report Management**
   - File: `20250908000001_report_table.cjs`
   - Added procedures from: `20250908000004_report_procedures.cjs`
   - Status: ✅ Merged

10. **Tourist Spots**
    - File: `20250817160000_tourist_spots_table.cjs`
    - Added procedures from: `20250912000100_tourist_spot_procedures.cjs`
    - Status: ✅ Merged

### Files to be Deleted
The following standalone procedure migration files can now be safely deleted:

1. `20250921000007_create_product_procedures.cjs`
2. `20250921000008_create_discount_procedures.cjs`
3. `20250921000009_create_service_procedures.cjs`
4. `20250921000010_create_order_procedures.cjs`
5. `20250921000011_create_review_procedures.cjs`
6. `20251001000006_create_notification_procedures.cjs`
7. `20251001000007_create_business_settings_procedures.cjs`
8. `20251005000003_create_service_inquiry_procedures.cjs`
9. `20250908000004_report_procedures.cjs`
10. `20250912000100_tourist_spot_procedures.cjs`

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Migration Structure**: Each feature now has a single migration file instead of two
2. **Atomic Operations**: Tables and their procedures are created/dropped together
3. **Easier to Maintain**: Related code is in one place
4. **Cleaner Migration History**: Fewer migration files to manage

## Migration Order
The consolidated migrations maintain the correct order:
- Tables are created first
- Stored procedures are created after tables
- On rollback: procedures are dropped first, then tables

## Testing Recommendations

After deleting the old procedure files:

1. Test fresh migrations on a clean database:
   ```bash
   npm run knex migrate:latest
   ```

2. Test rollback:
   ```bash
   npm run knex migrate:rollback
   ```

3. Verify all stored procedures are created correctly:
   ```sql
   SHOW PROCEDURE STATUS WHERE Db = 'your_database_name';
   ```

## Notes

- All procedure imports are maintained (no changes to procedure files themselves)
- Error handling is preserved in both `up` and `down` methods
- Console logging helps track procedure creation/deletion
- The original procedure files in the `procedures/` directory remain unchanged

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Review the consolidated migration files
2. ⏳ Delete the standalone procedure migration files
3. ⏳ Test migrations on a development database
4. ⏳ Update any documentation referencing old migration file names
