  variant={activeFilter === "ongoing" ? "solid" : "outlined"}
  color={activeFilter === "ongoing" ? "success" : "neutral"}
  onClick={() => setActiveFilter("ongoing")}
  startDecorator={<FiCheckCircle />}
  sx={{ cursor: "pointer" }}
>
  Ongoing ({getFilterCount("ongoing")})
</Chip>
```

### Features
- **Visual Feedback**: Active filter is shown with solid background
- **Count Badge**: Each chip displays the number of matching discounts
- **Interactive**: Click any chip to switch filters
- **Responsive**: Wraps nicely on smaller screens

## Filter Logic

### State Management
```typescript
type DiscountFilter = "all" | "ongoing" | "scheduled" | "expired" | "inactive";

const [activeFilter, setActiveFilter] = useState<DiscountFilter>("all");
```

### Filtering Function
```typescript
const filteredDiscounts = useMemo(() => {
  const now = new Date();

  return discounts.filter((discount) => {
    const startDate = new Date(discount.start_datetime);
    const endDate = discount.end_datetime ? new Date(discount.end_datetime) : null;

    switch (activeFilter) {
      case "all":
        return true;

      case "ongoing":
        return (
          discount.status === "active" &&
          startDate <= now &&
          (!endDate || endDate >= now)
        );

      case "scheduled":
        return discount.status === "active" && startDate > now;

      case "expired":
        return (
          discount.status === "expired" ||
          (endDate && endDate < now && discount.status !== "inactive")
        );

      case "inactive":
        return discount.status === "inactive" || discount.status === "paused";

      default:
        return true;
    }
  });
}, [discounts, activeFilter]);
```

### Count Function
```typescript
const getFilterCount = (filter: DiscountFilter): number => {
  // Similar logic to filteredDiscounts but returns count
  // Used to show badge numbers on filter chips
};
```

## User Experience Flow

### Initial Load
1. Page loads with "All Discounts" filter active
2. All filter chips show their respective counts
3. All discounts are displayed in the table

### Selecting a Filter
1. User clicks on a filter chip (e.g., "Ongoing")

## Filter Count Examples

```typescript
// Example discount data
const exampleDiscounts = [
  {
    name: "Summer Sale",
    status: "active",
    start_datetime: "2025-06-01T00:00:00Z",
    end_datetime: "2025-08-31T23:59:59Z"
  }, // Ongoing (if current date is July 2025)
  
  {
    name: "Black Friday",
    status: "active",
    start_datetime: "2025-11-29T00:00:00Z",
    end_datetime: "2025-11-29T23:59:59Z"
  }, // Scheduled (if current date is October 2025)
  
  {
    name: "Spring Sale",
    status: "expired",
    start_datetime: "2025-03-01T00:00:00Z",
    end_datetime: "2025-05-31T23:59:59Z"
  }, // Expired
  
  {
    name: "Old Promo",
    status: "inactive",
    start_datetime: "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    end_datetime: "2024-12-31T23:59:59Z"
  }, // Inactive
];

// Filter counts on October 1, 2025:
// All: 4
// Ongoing: 1 (Summer Sale - still running)
// Scheduled: 1 (Black Friday - coming up)
// Expired: 1 (Spring Sale - already ended)
// Inactive: 1 (Old Promo - manually disabled)
```

## Performance Optimization

### useMemo Hook
- Filtered discounts are memoized
- Only recalculates when `discounts` or `activeFilter` changes
- Prevents unnecessary re-renders

### Filter Count Caching
- Consider adding memoization if you have many discounts
- Currently recalculates on each render (acceptable for < 100 discounts)

## Accessibility

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Chips are focusable and clickable
- **Visual States**: Clear active/inactive states
- **Screen Readers**: Meaningful labels with counts

## Styling Details

### Active Chip
```css
variant: "solid"
color: [filter-specific-color]
```

### Inactive Chip
```css
variant: "outlined"
color: "neutral"
```

### Layout
```css
direction: "row"
spacing: 1
flexWrap: "wrap"
useFlexGap: true
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **Multi-select Filters**: Allow combining filters (e.g., Ongoing + Scheduled)
2. **Search Bar**: Text search within filtered results
3. **Sort Options**: Sort by name, date, usage, etc.
4. **Save Filter Preference**: Remember user's last selected filter
5. **URL Parameters**: Allow bookmarking specific filter views
6. **Date Range Filter**: Custom date range selection
