# Store Settings Implementation

## Overview
This iteration introduces the full Store Settings management experience for business owners. It connects the web app with the new backend endpoints powered by the `business_settings` table and stored procedures.

## Key Deliverables

### Frontend
- **Type Definitions (`city-venture-web/src/types/BusinessSettings.ts`)**  
  Provides strict typing for every field exposed by the backend along with a reusable `defaultBusinessSettings` object.
- **Service Layer (`city-venture-web/src/services/BusinessSettingsService.tsx`)**  
  Normalises API responses from stored procedures and exposes `fetchBusinessSettings` and `upsertBusinessSettings` helpers.
- **Settings Page (`city-venture-web/src/features/business/shop/store/Settings.tsx`)**  
  Replaces the placeholder with a multi-section configuration dashboard covering order handling, cancellations, booking rules, and automation controls.

### Backend (Already in repository)
- Migration `20251001000003_business_settings_table.cjs` defines schema and seeds defaults.
- Stored procedures from `20251001000007_create_business_settings_procedures.cjs` with controller + route wiring.

## UX Highlights
- Automatic loading of the selected business' configuration with graceful fallbacks.
- Dirty-state detection with Reset and Save controls.
- Inline validation + helper text for numeric fields, switches for boolean toggles, and contextual messaging.
- Success and error alerts to guide the user through updates.

## Next Steps
- Add audit logging when settings change.
- Display per-channel notification preferences once the messaging subsystem is available.
- Surface read-only insights (e.g., last modified by) when the backend exposes them.
